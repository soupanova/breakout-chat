SCENE 1 


KHANG   Hello, just one question. Why did you make me start?

DANA    Hello, just one answer: I had a feeling you know much better than me!

KHANG   I'm just as confused, just reading the instructions. You betrayed me.

DANA    Thank you for help and support!

KHANG   I guess we just keep the dialogue up until our session finishes?
